I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Intelligent Vehicles Group in WMG, University of Warwick. I did my PhD on "Deep learning Techniques for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction" under supervision of Prof. Mehrdad Dianati and Prof. Paul Jennings. My research focused on use of Convolutional neural network and Transformer Networks for time-series prediction.
